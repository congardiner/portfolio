      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Hello there! My name is Conner Gardiner. Life isn’t to be filled with regret for the moments that we don’t experience or are unable to remember. This is where capturing that moment, with the right person, tailored to the trained eye of a professional, makes all the difference. This is the *insert name* experience. I’m creating a website to showcase that experience, for both future and returning clients, all in one place. My website would serve as a landing page for my photography outlet, that can connect with potential clients, showcase my work, and allow them to get a quick snapshot and viewpoint of what I can offer them for my created niche. The functions of the site will include the ability to display my portfolio loading it statically, providing an about me and contact page, as well as room for future growth in the future.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The intended audience for this page is for individuals and families seeking to fulfill their desire to have special moments such as family events, engagements, graduation, and mission farewell moments recorded on the figments of this photographer. This is intended for all ages, content will reflect such, and be further supported by other streams of social media that will feed into this landing page.  </p>  <!-- change this -->

        Finding the Why Behind Your Story: (this will be a storyboard of finding my why via pictures and incremental text.)
        Phases of Finding Your Why

        1-- Envisioning:
        Visualizing the experience, the fine details, what it looks like, the smells, the sensation, why is that any different than from you are currently?

        Everyone wants to have the best of X,Y,and Z but they lack the fundamental systems to progress towards accomplishing worthwhile goals. Built each day, little by little, this is where the 'wins are made' well before they even happen. 

        Small changes compounding to form the 'big results' the caldestine dreams are often not overnight successes that just 'happen'. 
        >> Do you have core values, if so, identify very clearly what they are and write them down? What are you willing to sacrifice?


        2-- The Creation of Your Goal:

        How is this actually done?

        I'm sure we've all heard about a variety of goal planning methodologies, the means to make our 'greatest dreams happen' which as experience can suggest is often met with unfulfilled satisfaction from the lofty expectation that all I had to do was make the goal and 'work at it'
        
        So what actually happened then? What separates the conditions of this?

        3-- The Creation of Systems


        4-- "Doing rather than just trying"
          It is not enough to just make the attempt, to put in the time, or to make it the gym. While those are apart of the system itself, they are only a step in the process, not the process itself. 

          Optimizing our 'flow':

          1. time
          2. place
          3. preparation
          4. needs
          5. consistently making that the place to get things done.
          6. breaks (the promodoro effect)
          7. rinse, repeat and evaluate

          Simply put, we must plan to make the 'perfect effort' into the step of the system, not just the act of attempting. This is the defining label between trying and doing.

        5-- Evaluating the progress (short-term and long-term)
        
        The Ideal Perfect Motivation Vs Just Getting Started:

        Definitive Crossroads: The Act of Choosing

        6-- Appreciating the Journey

        Avoiding the act of comparison, the 'thief of joy' and the very instigator that prevents us from seeing our true selves. The beautiful process of reaching into the beyond and seeing what comes out. 


        (Could make this a blogpost section of sorts, combining my favorite elements of photography, motivations words of inspiration, creative wisdom, all into one great place!)

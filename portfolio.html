            <h1>Finding the Why Behind Your Story</h1>
            <p>
                1-- Envisioning:
                Visualizing the experience, the fine details, what it looks like, the smells, the sensation, why is that any different than where you are currently? Why do you want to change? Why would your life be different? Why would you be different?
            </p>    
                <p>Everyone wants to have the best of X,Y,and Z but they lack the fundamental systems to progress towards accomplishing worthwhile goals.</p> 
                <p>Built each day, little by little, this is where the 'wins are made' well before they even happen.</p>
        
                <p>Small changes compounding to form the 'big results' the caldestine dreams are often not overnight successes that just 'happen'.</p>
                <p>>> Do you have core values, if so, identify very clearly what they are and write them down!</p>  
        </div>

            <h1>Recreate the Journey</h1>
            <p>2-- The Creation of Your Goal:</p>
            <!-- maybe make this a heading, something to pop and stand as a landmark for the landing of the site. -->

            <h3>How is this actually done?</h3>
            <!-- maybe itialicize these portion, make it pop or stand out amongst the rest. -->

            <p>I'm sure we've all heard about a variety of goal planning methodologies, the means to make our 'greatest dreams happen' which as experience can suggest is often met with unfulfilled satisfaction from the lofty expectation that all I had to do was make the goal and 'work at it'</p>
            
            <p>So what actually happened then? What separates the conditions of this?</p>
            </p>
            <h1>3-- The Creation of Systems </h1> 
            <h2>4-- "Doing rather than just trying"</h2>
            <p>It is not enough to just make the attempt, to put in the time, or to make it the gym. While those are apart of the system itself, they are only a step in the process, not the process itself.</p>  
      
                <h3>Optimizing our 'flow':</h3>
      
                <p>1. time</p>
                <p>2. place</p>
                <p>3. preparation</p>
                <p>4. needs</p>
                <p>5. consistently making that the place to get things done.</p>
                <p>6. breaks (the promodoro effect)</p>
                <p>7. rinse, repeat and evaluate</p>
      
                Simply put, we must plan to make the 'perfect effort' into the step of the system, not just the act of attempting. This is the defining label between trying and doing. </h2>

            <h1>Appreciating the Journey</h1>
            <p> Avoiding the act of comparison, the 'thief of joy' and the very instigator that prevents us from seeing our true selves. </p>
            <p> The beautiful process of reaching into the beyond and seeing what comes out. </p>

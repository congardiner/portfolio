                <p>I'm sure we've all heard about a variety of goal planning methodologies, the means to make our 'greatest dreams happen' which as experience can suggest is often met with unfulfilled satisfaction from the lofty expectation that all I had to do was make the goal and 'work at it'</p>
                
                <p>So what actually happened then? What separates the conditions of this?</p>
                </p>
                <p>It is not enough to just make the attempt, to put in the time, or to make it the gym. While those are apart of the system itself, they are only a step in the process, not the process itself.</p>
